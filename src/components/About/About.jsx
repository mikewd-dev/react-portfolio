        ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Dawson â€” a frontend developer based in the UK who enjoys building fast, accessible web apps. Iâ€™ve built full-stack projects using JavaScript, React, and Node.js, and recently completed a remote internship where I contributed production-ready features using Next.js, Prisma, and Stripe. I focus on clean UI, responsiveness, and real-world problem solving.
